A list of Ruby data types<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Numbers</b> - These can be either an Integer (whole number) or a float (using a decimal point).</li>
<li><b>Boolean</b> - This represnts an item of information based on using a True or False argument</li>
<li><b>Strings</b> - A string is a group of letters used to represent sentences or words, they normally are defined by double or single quotation marks.</li>
<li><b>Hashes</b> - These use values assigned to a key, therefore made up something called key pairs, every key holds a value</li>
<li><b>Arrays</b> - These store lists of data, elements of an array are attached to an index represented by a number, index numbers start at 0</li>
<li><b>Symbols</b> - These are 'lightweight' strinfs, preceeded by a colon, they are used due to taking up less memory</li>
</ul>

Reflect and Review<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Executing Ruby code in IRB - This is know as a REPL (read-eval-print-loop). It is an interactive programming enviroment that takes an input and returns a result. It is a quick way to test how parts of a programme might run without having to write a full method or programme, it allows you to experiment with parts of a method etc. </li>
<li>Strings - Strings are the representation of words or sentences in Ruby, stings are used to return a visual output, which can be read by an end user. Strings are an Object which means you can send messages or Methods as they are called, to have the object act in different ways.</li>
<li>String Concatenation - This is the ability to join strings together to form sentences etc.</li>
<li>Variables - Variables are named containers for storing data. Variable can be made up of strings, booleans, hashes, arrays or numbers. Variables are assigned values which are returned when the varaible is called into action.</li>
<li>Return Values - These are what is returned as an end point when a method or programme is run. This can be a visual output such as a string, number or boolean. The return value isn't always visual however, a method may run and then influence another part of a programme. The eventual output may result in something like a light switching for example.</li>
