<h2>Induction at Makers Academy</h2>
<br>
The morning started at 10am when we met with our fellow cohort and our first coach.<br>
<br>
There was a brief ice breaking exercise in pairs where we discussed a number of different things and presented back to the group.<br>
<br>
Following this, expectations, both in the short term and the long term were established.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Our coach discussed what we had undertaken in terms of a career path, that software engineering is a big world and can depend heavily on large numbers of files, databases, servers and individuals all working on one project at a time. Software engineering is a collaborative industry, through methodologies such as pairing, stand-ups, mob sessions etc.</li>

<li>The learning curve keeps on going, software moves fast and is very detail dependent, the bootcamp will only teach a small part of this, however it will train us to know where to look for information and techniques to use to research and seek out answers.</li>

<li>Standard Expectations were set, for example Timekeeping, how to log hours, how to engage in the course, how to consult with coaches, mental wellbeing, the code of conduct and safeguarding.</li>
</ul>

We then looked through the general schedule for the first four weeks of the programme which is a mixture of peer check-ins, independent work and pair programming.

We then had an induction checklist to work through.

This was made up of completing a slack profile, setting up and administering our Github accounts, becoming familiar with the system used to log hours in and out, opening up the portal to log progress for the apprenticeship, writing a personal statement and finally commencing the basic programming module.

After lunch, we had a session with Maker’s chief joy officer, who discussed holistic and emotional intelligence with us. Personally, I find this one of the most important things about our working lives, it's important that a culture shifts from 100% productivity to a mixture of productivity and employee wellbeing. In my opinion, having an employee’s mental wellbeing at the forefront of everything you do will naturally create a positive effect on productivity. It is refreshing and encouraging to see Makers adopt this approach.
